| Milk           | 250 ml       | full fat milk, UHT is OK|
| Water          | 75 ml       | tap water is ok |
| Lemon skin     | 2 peels | if you do not use lemons often|
| Cinamon        | 1 stick | cinamon powder is NOT OK. but is also nice without the stick |



Note about sugar: usually recipes recommend around twice as much sugrar as the 150 grams above. The important is that the proportion of sugar:water if 2:1 in grams/ml. Basically, simple sirup as done for cocktails.

## For the pastry

TODO - this part never came good so far. I use mostly on pre-made puff pastry. 

# Process

1. Put all the milk in a pan with the lemon skins and cinamon stick, then slowly add the flour. It should make slimmy consistency. If there are lumps, to not worry, it will be filtered in the end. Lets it reach boil, then put heat to low.

2. In another pot, put the water and the sugar. Mix it and take from the heat when it starts boiling. The liquid should clear and slightly viscous. 

3. Now comes the  is critical step. Pour the sirup into the milk **very slowly while mixing**. If dropping the sirup too fast, the mix will become curdly and the custard is spoiled. 

4. Let it cool down, when cold, add the egg yolks and mix it well.

5. In a metal cast for cakes, put the pastry and push it to the walls of the cast same as used for muffins, for example, but must be metal).

6. Leave in the oven at 250 C, for 15 minutes

7. Eat. Warm or cold is fine.
